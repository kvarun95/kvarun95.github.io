I am a PhD candidate with the [Computational Imaging Science Lab](https://anastasio.bioengineering.illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Mark A. Anastasio](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/people/maa). 

My work is about developing ML-based algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems, with applications to medical imaging. I have also worked on compressive microscopy, phase retrieval, physics of optical tomography, statistical optics and objective assessment of image quality. 

I completed my undergrad (B.Tech.) in Engineering Physics from [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in July 2017, and my MS in ECE from UIUC in August 2019. 

I did a research internship in the Algorithmic Systems Group at [Analog Garage, Analog Devices Inc.](https://www.analog.com/en/landing-pages/001/analog-garage.html) in summer of 2019 where I worked on algorithms for 3D time-of-flight imaging, and another at [LIGO 40m Lab, Caltech](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/) in summer of 2016 where I worked on audio processing algorithms for interferometer signals.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
