I am a Research Scientist in the Algorithmic Systems Group within the Analog Garage, which is the research incubator of Analog Devices, Inc. My research is about computational imaging and sensing algorithms. 

I defended my PhD in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in May, 2023. I was a part of the [Computational Imaging Science Lab](https://anastasio.bioengineering.illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Mark A. Anastasio](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/people/maa). 

My PhD research was about developing ML-based algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems, with applications to medical imaging. I have also worked on compressive microscopy, phase retrieval, physics of optical tomography, statistical optics and objective assessment of image quality. 

I completed my undergrad (B.Tech.) in Engineering Physics from [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in July 2017, and my MS in ECE from UIUC in August 2019. 

I have done research internships at [Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs](https://www.merl.com/) (summer 2022), Algorithmic Systems Group at [Analog Garage, Analog Devices Inc.](https://www.analog.com/en/landing-pages/001/analog-garage.html) (summer 2019), and [LIGO 40m Lab, Caltech](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/) (summer 2016). I worked on various signal processing and imaging problems throughout these internships.
